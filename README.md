# Med_Appointment-Analysis
Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree First Project

## Introduction
This dataset contains information on over a hundred thousand medical appointments in Brazil, and focuses mainly on the question whether or not patients show up for their appointments. For each row, there is information on a number of characteristics of the patient such as the patient's id, gender, age, appointment date, and so on.


### Questions for Analysis
* How often did people miss appointments?

* Does the gender of the patient has a relation with the absence?

* Does the age of the patient have a relation with the absence?

* Did patients miss appointments because of not receiving a message??

* Does the scholarship affect the patient's attendance?

## Conclusions
Based on the analyzed dataset, it was found that almost 80% (specifically 79.81%) of patients attended their appointments, while 20.19% of patients missed their appointments. When considering gender, it was noticed that females had a higher percentage of missed appointments compared to males when analyzed separately. However, it is important to note that the population of male patients was smaller than that of female patients, which could have affected the percentage figures if the number of male patients was equal to that of females.

Moreover, the dataset indicated that different age groups had varying percentages of no-shows, with the elderly missing the least number of appointments and teenagers missing the most. Although it is not definitive, it is possible that the elderly miss fewer appointments because they become more conscious of their health as they grow older.

Furthermore, certain days of the week had higher percentages of no-shows, with Saturday having the least number of appointments but the highest percentage of no-shows. Surprisingly, the relationship between receiving SMS reminders and no-shows was opposite to what was expected, with patients who received SMS reminders having a higher percentage of no-shows.

Lastly, patients with scholarships were found to miss their appointments more than those without scholarships.

​
#### Limitation
A significant limitation of this analysis was the absence of some background information for the patients. or instance, it was discovered that only about 32% of the appointments had received SMS notifications. However, it is possible that those patients were only encouraged to enroll in SMS notifications after missing appointments, suggesting that they were already experiencing difficulties keeping up with their appointments

Another limitation of is that although there is some data on the patients' conditions, there is no information on the specific health reasons for each appointment. This absence of information is problematic since some health reasons are more life-threatening than others, and patients with such conditions may be more likely to attend their appointments compared to those with less severe conditions.
